Static websites are back! The days when businesses used to have moving characters all over their landing page to make it look interesting have now faded into oblivion. Organizations both large and small are using static websites these days. If you are a tech-newbie (been there, done that), you might not be that familiar with the terms. It doesn\u2019t help that we are flooded with thousands of new terms every day in this technical world. Technically, a static website is built using only HTML and CSS and does not involve scripting. To change the content that appears source code needs to be edited directly. The dynamic web page consists of both back-end and the front-end scripts to host the web pages within a website. Dynamic websites interact with the database to serve content, unlike static websites. In simple words, a static website is the one where the content on the website stays the same for every visit whereas for a dynamic website the content changes with every visit. For example, your favorite daily feed and interaction platform a.k.a. Facebook is a dynamic website, whereas a site talking about a particular service, say some book, is static. Now the question that arises is what compelled this sudden comeback of these websites? Was it the changing technological scenarios? Ease of familiarity or something else entirely? Or it is a classic case of \u2018What goes around comes around\u2019? Whatever may be the case, they are back, and stronger than ever. If you are still in two minds about going for it, then worry not. I\u2019ve listed out all the cool reasons why you should try static websites today! Buckle up, you are in for an interesting ride!! Security As there\u2019s no intermediary, i.e., the database involved, the threat of code injection is minimal for a static website. No plugins and dynamic software to host the website. Static websites are a safe bet compared to dynamic ones when it comes to security as they don\u2019t rely on CMS plugins. APIs and JavaScript are used to handle the dynamic functions of static websites, eliminating the risk of getting hacked. On the other hand, active websites are highly prone to get hacked due to multiple content sources and plugins. A report by WP WhiteSecurity states that about 70% of WordPress sites are at risk of getting hacked by malicious hackers because of lack of maintenance and upgrading. Ugh, scary. Reliability You must have occasionally come across an error message saying that, \"The connection could not be established.\u2019 This primarily occurs because of the database errors. Serving just basic HTML files makes it easier to host them anywhere with ease like on a CDN. Hence, whenever there\u2019d be an attack on the server, the static website is just redirected to other closest node, unlike its dynamic alternative where the website might go down for few hours. Speed The absence of middleman/database makes the static site much more speedy and easy to load. A static site is ten times faster than a dynamic site that is built with a CMS. Another reason for a static website to run faster is that it can be served from the node closest to the browser. According to research by Kissmetrics, about 47% of people expect the website to load within 2 seconds, and a whopping 40% of people will not wait for the website to load for longer than 3 seconds. Hence, getting a static website also helps in getting more traffic by reducing abandonment rate caused due to slow loading. Website loading time Source: KISSmetrics Hosting and Price Static websites have basic HTML files which require less space making the hosting of these websites cheaper to that of dynamic websites. Organizations with static website save up on the costs and channel those resources to integrate Git or automated builds to incorporate the latest changes in the system. Scalability What to do when your website is finally up and running? Handling massive traffic on a dynamic website might be a cumbersome process as it requires complex code playing on the server. Basic static websites with HTML files can be easily scaled up by just increasing the bandwidth. Technological Advancements Website development There was a time when online store websites would have to rely on dynamic websites for their organization and integrate those complex coding and deal with tedious scripting. With tools like Magento, it is possible to have a static website for shop-centric businesses. A Java-script based shopping cart, called Snipcart, integrates e-commerce site\u2019s functionalities to a static website, eliminating the need for dynamic websites. Snipcart dashboard can manage sales and product inventories, and its API can be integrated with shipping service providers and inventory management software systems as well. With some static generators and static website hosting platforms that allow Github integration, global CDN, SSL certificates along with free custom domains. Hosting providers such Netlify, go up the notch and even deal with redirects such as 404 errors, proxies, and even password protection. Therefore, it is safe to say that static websites have made a terrific comeback and they are here to stay with more advantages than drawbacks. As a website is a digital face of the business, organizations must take into consideration all the factors and necessities of their business website and must assess all the new tools and platforms before making a website. 6 Reasons Why You Should Go for a Static Website Dynamic is so last generation.

Static websites are back! The days when businesses used to have moving characters all over their landing page to make it look interesting have now faded into oblivion. Organizations both large and small are using static websites these days. If you are a tech-newbie (been there, done that), you might not be that familiar with the terms. It doesn\u2019t help that we are flooded with thousands of new terms every day in this technical world. Technically, a static website is built using only HTML and CSS and does not involve scripting.
