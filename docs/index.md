## Introduction

Through the integration of traditionally disparate technology based systems, and the delivery of related consulting services Smart Deskers will facilitate the creation of integrated and connected workspaces.

Smart Deskers will participate in all phases of the workspace life-cycle from Design, Implementation, through to Management. At each stage the appropriate use of data-driven technologies will provide quantitative information to ensure that designs are fit for purpose, implementation is undertaken efficiently, and resource utilisation is optimised.

To achieve this SmartDeskers will work with Office Designers and Architects, and Managers of Facilities, IT, and People. 

Systems integration may include:
Monitoring of the workspace environment and utilisation
Building Management
Energy Management
Resource Management e.g. Room booking.
